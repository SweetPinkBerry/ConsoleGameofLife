# ConsoleGameofLife

A console implementation of Conway's Game of Life, where the user inputs two positive integers, which are then used to create the grid of the game.
The game is then automatically progressed to the point where either all cells are dead, or a pattern has been found. The current implementation only handles an alternating pattern of two turns.
